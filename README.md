  <h2>Course Code: 22IS58L</h2>

  <h3>5th Semester Information Science and Engineering (JSSSTU) Computer Networks Lab  Cycle Programs.</h3>

  <h4>1. Implement 3 nodes point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.</h4>
  
  <h4>2. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.</h4>

  <h4>3. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source/destination</h4>

  <h4>4. To Create scenario and study the performance of token ring protocols through simulation (Using Ring topology)</h4>

  <h4>5. To Create scenario and study the performance of token ring protocols through simulation (Using Star Topology)</h4>
  
  <h4>6. To create scenario & study the performance of token bus protocol through simulator (Bus topology)</h4>

  <h4>7. To simulate and study stop and wait protocol</h4>

  <h4>8. To simulate and study sliding window protocol</h4>

  <h4>9. To Simulate and study of Go Back N Protocol</h4>

  <h4>10. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.</h4>

  <h4>11. Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2</h4>

  <h4>12. Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2</h4>
